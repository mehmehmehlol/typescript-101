Typescript 101
=====
created on Feb 23 2021

## Typescript Overview

### TypeScript adds:
- types
- build-in errors
- next-gen JS Features (compiled down for older Browsers), like Babel
- Non-JS Features like Interfaces or Generics
- Meta-Programming Features like Decorators
- Rich Configuration Options
- Modern Tooling that helps even in non-TypeScript Projects

## TypeScript Basics

#### Core Types

1. `number` (no special types): 1, 5.3, -10 All numbers, no differentioation between integers or floats
2. `string`: 'Hi', "Hi", \`Hi\` All text values
3. `boolean`: `true`, `false` Just these two, no "truthy" or "falsy" values

\* TypeScript's **type system only helps you during development** (i.e. before the code gets compiled).

Key Difference: JS - use **"dynamic types"** (resolved at runtime) vs TS - use **"static types"** (set during development)

TS knows more types than JS.
